## Overview

DIY is designed to put AI development into the hands of everyone. By leveraging visual workflow builders, integrated AI model hubs, memory/context management, and a modular multi?agent system, this framework enables rapid prototyping and deployment of AI-powered applications. All components�from the frontend to backend services�are built using TypeScript, ensuring type safety, consistency, and easier collaboration.

## Features

### ?? Visual Workflow Builder
- **Drag?and?Drop Interface:** Create and manage AI workflows without code.
- **Real?Time Preview:** Instantly see results and make adjustments.
- **Reusable Components:** Build workflows using pre?built components that can be extended or customized.
- **Version Control:** Track changes and collaborate with team members.

### ?? Model Integration Hub
- **Seamless Integration:** Connect with popular AI models (e.g., GPT?based, image generation, etc.).
- **API Management:** Built?in support for token handling, rate limiting, and performance monitoring.
- **Cost Optimization:** Monitor and optimize API usage to manage costs effectively.

### ?? Memory & Context Management
- **Vector Database:** Persist embeddings and conversation history for long?term context.
- **Context Window Management:** Ensure smooth transitions in conversations and workflows.
- **Custom Knowledge Base:** Build and maintain a dynamic knowledge repository.

### ?? Agent Creation Studio
- **Visual Agent Configuration:** Define agent behaviors, roles, and goals using an intuitive interface.
- **Multi?Agent Coordination:** Configure inter?agent interactions and monitor their performance.
- **Constraint & Goal Specification:** Set rules, constraints, and fallback strategies for agents.

### ?? Multimodal Processing
- **Text Processing:** Advanced natural language understanding and generation.
- **Speech Integration:** Speech?to?text and text?to?speech capabilities.
- **Image & Video Analysis:** Tools for processing and generating images and videos.

### ?? Integration Layer
- **REST API & WebSockets:** Support for real?time applications and integrations.
- **SDKs:** TypeScript?based SDKs for custom development and external integrations.
- **Export & Deployment:** Export your projects as standalone deployments or integrate them into existing infrastructures.

## Architecture

DIY is built on a modular, multi?layered architecture designed for scalability and extensibility.

### Frontend

- **Technology:** React with TypeScript
- **Components:**
  - **Visual Workflow Builder:** Utilize libraries such as [react-dnd](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about) for a dynamic drag?and?drop interface.
  - **Real?Time Interface:** Implement WebSocket (e.g., Socket.IO) clients for live updates.
  - **UI Components:** Build a reusable, TypeScript?based component library.
- **Tooling:** Webpack or Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Jest for testing.

### Backend

- **Technology:** Node.js with TypeScript (using frameworks like Express or NestJS)
- **Services:**
  - **API Gateway:** Routes HTTP requests and manages WebSocket communication.
  - **Model Orchestration Engine:** Coordinates calls to external AI models.
  - **Memory Management Service:** Maintains context using lightweight vector databases initially, scaling to dedicated solutions later.
  - **Agent Execution Runtime:** Executes tasks as defined in the visual workflows.
- **Communication:** RESTful APIs, WebSockets, and message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka).

### Data Layer

- **Vector Database:** Begin with embedded solutions (e.g., SQLite with vector extensions) and transition to services like Pinecone or Qdrant.
- **Cache Layer:** Utilize Redis for fast data retrieval.
- **Blob Storage:** Manage media files and large datasets.

### Infrastructure

- **Containerization:** Docker for consistent development and production environments.
- **Orchestration:** Docker Compose for development; Kubernetes for scalable production deployments.
- **CI/CD:** Automated testing and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker:** [Download & Install](https://www.docker.com/)
- **Node.js v18+:** [Download & Install](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python 3.9+:** [Download & Install](https://www.python.org/)
- **Git:** [Download & Install](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-DIY-Framework/diy.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd framework
pnpm install
```

### Running the Development Environment

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command initializes both the frontend and backend services, launching the visual workflow builder and API gateway with live reload capabilities.
